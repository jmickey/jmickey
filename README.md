### About Me

I'm a software and infrastructure engineer, hobbyist data scientist, photographer, cyclist, and dog owner living in Cambridge, UK. I specialise in container orchestration, software development, continuous delivery, and cloud operations. With over a decade of experience, I have extensive knowledge of a range of technologies within the infrastructure and software engineering spaces, including:

* Kubernetes & containers, including Docker
* AWS cloud administration
* Linux & Windows operating systems
* Go, Python, C#, Java programming languages
* infrastructure as code, with extensive Terraform experience
* Continuous integration & delivery systems (CircleCI, ConcourseCI, TeamCity)
* Agile development methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)

I'm current at [Snyk](https://snyk.io) as a senior engineer working on solving container and Kubernetes security challenges. Previously I worked at [CondÃ© Nast](https://condenast.com) and [Bankwest](https://bankwest.com.au) solving large and medium scale platform/infrastructure problems.

Occasionally I speak at tech events and meetups, you can see my various slide decks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey).

Originally from Perth Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, I now live in Cambridge UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and work in London. I moved to the UK in December, 2018 while my partner completes her PhD in Cancer Biology at Cambridge University in partnership with the [Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/grand-challenge-award/funded-teams-hannon).
